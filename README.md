## Python to build database

This framework also includes a number of python scripts to build up the database used by CharVis. Some were authored by Paul Bucci, some were not. As such, each file contains a tag at the top to identify the author. All front-end appliction development was authored by Paul Bucci, with the exception of the CSS, of which some was taken from a React tutorial base.
